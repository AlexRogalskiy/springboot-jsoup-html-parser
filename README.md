# `springboot-jsoup-html-parser`

The goal of this project is to get a list of games and their scores from a website. The application must parse the
website HTML content, get the necessary information, save the data in a database and expose them through a REST API.

## Microservices

The project consists of two microservices: `game-score-api` and `game-score-collector`.

### game-score-api

Spring boot Java Web application that exposes a REST API from where clients can retrieve the game score data stored in
`MongoDB` database.

| Endpoints                 | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/games`          | this endpoint returns all game score with pagination |
| `GET /api/games/{title}`  | this endpoint returns a specific game score          |

### game-score-collector

Spring boot Java application responsible for calling the game score website, parse the HTML content (using
[`jsoup`](https://jsoup.org/)) and save the data in [`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. It will be
configured to run from time to time in order to keep the application updated about the information the website provides. 

## Execution Types

There are two types of execution, `Development` and `Production`. The first uses [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/),
[`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org/). The second needs:
[`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/), [`Minikube`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/#install-minikube),
[`Helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-the-helm-client) and [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/)

> **Note**. We are not going to explain how to install all of them because there are many good tutorials available on the internet.

### Development

#### Start environment

Open a terminal and inside `springboot-jsoup-html-parser` root folder run the command below. It will start a `MongoDB`
container at port `27017` and `Mongo Express` at port `8081`.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Start Microservices

In a terminal run `game-score-api`. It is Java Web application.
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run --projects game-score-api
```

In another terminal run `game-score-collector`. It is a Java application that does its job and terminates. Ideally,
it will be executed as a cronjob, scheduled to run during specific time intervals.
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run --projects game-score-collector
```

#### Simulation

In order to test the application, you can access `game-score-api` Swagger website: http://localhost:8080

Another way is to `curl`. For example, the command below returns the game score results with pagination: page 0,
size 10, sorted descending by `score` field.
```
curl -i "http://localhost:8080/api/games?page=0&size=10&sort=score%2Cdesc"
```

#### Mongo Express

[`Mongo Express`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express) is a web-based MongoDB admin interface. It is started
docker-compose is run. Mongo Express can be accessed at http://localhost:8081

#### Running Tests

Both `game-score-api` and `game-score-collector`, have a set of test cases. In order to run them, just execute the
following script inside `springboot-jsoup-html-parser` root folder.
```
./mvnw clean test
```

#### Shutdown

To stop and remove containers, networks and volumes
```
docker-compose down -v
```

### Production

#### Start environment

Open one terminal and run the command below to start `Minikube`
```
minikube start
```

Use `Minikube` Docker Daemon. Instead of pushing the docker image to Docker Registry, we will simply build the image
using the `Minikube` Docker daemon. For it, run the command below to set `Minikube` host.
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
> When `Minikube` host won't be used anymore, you can undo this change by running   
> ```
> eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
> ```

Next step is to init `Helm`
```
helm init --service-account default
```
> **Note**. Wait a few seconds so that `tiller` get ready. The following error will be throw if `tiller` is not ready yet.
> ```
> Error: could not find a ready tiller pod
> ```

Finally, inside `springboot-jsoup-html-parser` root folder, run the following commands to build the docker images of
`game-score-api` and `game-score-collector`.

**game-score-api**
```
./mvnw clean package dockerfile:build -DskipTests --projects game-score-api
```
| Environment Variable | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| `MONGODB_HOST` | Specify host of the `Mongo` database to use (default `localhost`) |
| `MONGODB_PORT` | Specify port of the `Mongo` database to use (default `27017`) |

**game-score-collector**
```
./mvnw clean package dockerfile:build -DskipTests --projects game-score-collector
```
| Environment Variable | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| `MONGODB_HOST` | Specify host of the `Mongo` database to use (default `localhost`) |
| `MONGODB_PORT` | Specify port of the `Mongo` database to use (default `27017`) |

#### Deployment

Still inside `springboot-jsoup-html-parser` root folder, run the following script
```
./deploy-all.sh
```
> **Note**. To check the progress of the deployment run
> ```
> kubectl get pods,cronjobs,jobs
> ```

The deployment will install `MongoDB` helm chart, run the job `game-score-collector-job` to get data from website for
the first time, deploy `game-score-api` and, finally, deploy the cronjob `game-score-collector-cronjob` that will run
every `hh:00, hh:10, hh:20, hh:30, hh:40 and hh:50` to get updated data from website.

#### Simulation

In order to test the application, run the following command to get the `game-score-api` url
```
GAME_SCORE_API=$(minikube service game-score-api-service --url)
echo $GAME_SCORE_API
```

Copy the url shown above and paste in a browser. It will open the`game-score-api` swagger website.

Another way is to use `curl`. For example, the command below returns the game score results with pagination: page 0,
size 10, sorted descending by `score` field.
```
curl -i "$GAME_SCORE_API/api/games?page=0&size=10&sort=score%2Cdesc"
```

#### Shutdown

The following script delete all deployments
```
./cleaning-up.sh
```

The command below shuts down the Minikube Virtual Machine, but preserves all cluster state and data. Starting the
cluster again will restore it to itâ€™s previous state.
```
minikube stop
```

The command below shuts down and deletes the Minikube Virtual Machine. No data or state is preserved.
```
minikube delete
```
